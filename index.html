            <li>Paragraphs are indicated by P starting from 1-6 for example P1 P2 surrounded by <></li>
            <li>li or ol is to indicate bullet points</li>
            <li>!DOCTYPE is not case-sensitive because it is a declaration. Declarations are not case-sensitive; HTML elements are case-sensitive</li>
            <li>lang="en", which tells the browser the language for the webpage</li>
            <li>Metadata is data about our webpage that the browser uses to effectively serve our webpage to users. Metadata is typically not seen by users, but it contains important information about accessibility, search engines, and performance</li>
            <li>The style element defines the CSS styles associated with a website</li>
            <li>The base element defines the base URL for a webpage</li>
            <li>The link element connects an external resource to the HTML document</li>
            <li>The head element in this case defines the following three elements:
                The charset element sets our character encoding.
                The http-equiv element sets an HTTP header for content.
                The viewport element sets the default view for our webpage.</li>

          <li>The box-shadow CSS property adds shadow effects around an element's frame</li>
          <li>The border property assigns a border with a width of 5px that is solid and gray</li>

        <ul>
          <li>Math.floor() and Math.random() are both properties of JavaScript's built-in Math object that can be used together to generate a random number</li>
          <li>Control flow is the order in which a computer executes code in a script</li>
          <li>A variable is a named container that allows us to store data in our code</li>
          <li>To work with individual data items inside an array, we need to have one more piece of information: the location of the data item in the array. This location is identified with a unique number called an index</li>
          <li>A FOR loop uses the predictable pattern of indices to perform a task on all the items in an array by allowing a single code block to be executed over and over. Developers must use another statement, such as the conditional IF statement that we just learned, to interrupt the control flow by executing a block of code a specific number of times</li>
          <li>The first statement determines the starting point for our loop. Since we want to start at the beginning of the array, we declare a variable x and give it a value of 0 (because the first index of an array is always 0)</li>
          <li>The second statement is the condition. As long as the number in the variable x is less than the length of the array, the loop will keep running</li>
