The Older me will look back on this and think wow i could have just done it once, but i still think it was good practice



## Usage

Provide instructions and examples for use. Include screenshots as needed.
First i had to create a repository on github, then i had to link my account so that i can access the repository from my computer without changing the main file everytime i worked on it; i believe they called it a remote connection of some sort, after i had made the repository it was pretty simple i would make a file in the git bash console and then i would edit the file on Virtual Studio and then repeat the process, you would just have to think of using the console as making a file from scratch or downloading a file from the internet. Ex: you would have to unzip the file and format it to whatever you wanted to work on with that file, we had went though css html and javascript; the very basics of coding but as long as you have a good frame anybody can make a house it just might take some people longer than others.

Badges aren't necessary, but they demonstrate street cred. Badges let other developers know that you know what you're doing. Check out the badges hosted by [shields.io](https://shields.io/). You may not understand what they all represent now, but you will in time.

## Features

If your project has a lot of features, list them here.

## How to Contribute

If you created an application or package and would like other developers to contribute to it, you can include guidelines for how to do so. The [Contributor Covenant](https://www.contributor-covenant.org/) is an industry standard, but you can always write your own if you'd prefer.

## Tests

Go the extra mile and write tests for your application. Then provide examples on how to run them here.

To add a screenshot, create an `assets/images` folder in your repository and upload your screenshot to it. Then, using the relative file path, add it to your README using the following syntax:
